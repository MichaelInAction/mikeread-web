I worked as secretary to update our attendance system from paper\n          to an automated spreadsheet system. As president, I gained a lot of experience in\n          managing people, delegating tasks, and working through problems.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <hr/>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <h1 id=\"experience\">Experience</h1>\n        <p>I spent the summer of 2018, as well as the 2018-2019 academic year,\n          interning at IBM in Southbury, CT working on Corporate Applications. I learned a lot of valuable skills from this internship, as well\n          as many new technologies that I would not have otherwise come into contact with.\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          Outside of academics, I have experience in leadership through Kappa Kappa Psi, an\n          honorary band service fraternity. I was elected Secretary of our chapter for the 2017-2018 academic year,\n          and I was also elected president of our chapter for the 2018-2019 academic year. This organization\n          has given me a lot of good experience in the field of leadership, learning how to effectively\n          work in a group setting.</p>\n      </div>\n      <Banner img={bg2}/>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <h1 id=\"education\">Education</h1>\n        <p>I am a graduate of Marist College, where I earned my bachelor's in\n          Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development.
