/>\n          <p>\n            I am a software developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Marist College. I enjoy nature, movies, games, and music.\n            When I'm not at work or working on a project, I can usually be found jamming out with my headphones on or watching through\n            the Marvel movies for the 30th time.\n          </p>\n          <br className=\"break\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <h1 id=\"skills\">Skills</h1>\n        <h4>Technical</h4>\n        <p>As a computer scientist, I have hands on experience with a multitude of\n          different languages and technologies. The main languages that I have had experience\n          with are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Python</li>\n          <li>JavaScript/HTML/CSS</li>\n          <li>Java</li>\n          <li>SQL</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>I also have done some work with PHP and R.</p>\n        <p>Some technologies of note that I have worked with are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>MySQL/PostgreSQL</li>\n          <li>Tensorflow/Keras</li>\n          <li>ReactJS</li>\n          <li>Angular</li>\n          <li>NodeJS</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>I have also done a little bit of Android development using Java.</p>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        <h4>Other</h4>\n        <p>From my experience working with my software development team at IBM, I\n          developed a strong team-based mindset, and strong collaborative skills.\n          I also, from my time working with Kappa Kappa Psi, have gained a lot of leadership\n          experience. I worked as secretary to update our attendance system from paper\n          to an automated spreadsheet system. As president, I gained a lot of experience in\n          managing people, delegating tasks, and working through problems.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <hr/>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <h1 id=\"experience\">Experience</h1>\n        <p>I spent the summer of 2018, as well as the 2018-2019 academic year,\n          interning at IBM in Southbury, CT working on Corporate Applications. I learned a lot of valuable skills from this internship, as well\n          as many new technologies that I would not have otherwise come into contact with.\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          Outside of academics, I have experience in leadership through Kappa Kappa Psi, an\n          honorary band service fraternity. I was elected Secretary of our chapter for the 2017-2018 academic year,\n          and I was also elected president of our chapter for the 2018-2019 academic year. This organization\n          has given me a lot of good experience in the field of leadership, learning how to effectively\n          work in a group setting.</p>\n      </div>\n      <Banner img={bg2} align='left' />\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <h1 id=\"education\">Education</h1>\n        <img src={marist} className=\"inline-image-right\" alt=\"marist\" />\n        <p>I am a graduate of Marist College, where I earned my bachelor's in\n          Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development.
